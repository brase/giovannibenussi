As programmers we are always learning new things: languages, frameworks, tools,
libraries, patterns. It's a never ending list. However, there's a part of
learning that is not mentioned commonly. The main idea is that you invest time
to learn how to do something well once, and you can apply that knowledge for all
your future changes.

You might not be aware of this, but you're kind of applying this pattern:

- You don't know how to do something.
- You learn how to do it to "make things work".
- Next time you copy-paste your previous solution.

And then one day, you find out a bug, so you continue the process:

- You don't know how to fix the bug.
- You learn how to fox it to "make things work".
- Next time, copy-paste the improved version.

Or maybe you want to generalize your solution:

- You don't know how apply your solution for most use-cases.
- You learn how everything works and come up with a solution.
- Next time, copy-paste the improved version.

Did you see a pattern? You always start with a task (feature, bug fix) that needs to be done, you search a solution for it, and apply this solution everywhere. Most often than not, the first solution you came with it's not the best one and sooner than later it needs a fix because you don't understand how it worked completely.

Most often than not, the first solution you came with is not ideal:

- Can have bugs.
- Slow performance.
- Edge cases.
- Not concise enough as it should be.
