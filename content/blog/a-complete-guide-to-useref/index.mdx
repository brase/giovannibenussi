# What's useRef
useRef allows you to keep a mutable value within a component, similar to useState or instance variables on a class, without triggering re-renders.

## Difference with useState
useState triggers a re-render everytime it's updated and useRef doesn't. In the following example I added two buttons: one updates its count with useRef and the other one with useState. You'll notice that clicking on the button with useRef doesn't trigger a re-render and thus, the view isn't updated. It will be only noticeable when you click the button that uses useState.

## Difference with a variable
- Refs to access DOM nodes
- Why not just use a variable?
- Why not use useState?
- Use cases for refs: usePrevious
- Lazy Initialization
- Conceptually, you can think of refs as similar to instance variables in a class. Unless you're doing lazy initialization, avoid setting refs during rendering - this can lead to surprising behavior. Instead, typically you want to modify refs in event handlers and effects.
- Callback refs

This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.

You can also write code blocks here!

```js
const saltyDuckEgg = "chinese preserved food product"
```
